# GitHub infrastructure

The JSON files in this directory are the desired state for repository-level
GitHub settings. `scripts/github-settings.ts` validates the files and can
compare or apply the settings through the GitHub REST API.

```sh
node scripts/github-settings.ts --check
node scripts/github-settings.ts --check --remote
```

`check` is local and does not need credentials. `drift` reads the repository
from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` or the `origin` remote and compares managed settings,
rulesets, environments, and required secret names with GitHub. Secret values
are never read or written.

Mutation is deliberately restricted to an explicit local opt-in or the
protected `workflow_dispatch` run on `main`:

```sh
ALLOW_GITHUB_SETTINGS_APPLY=1 \
GH_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
node scripts/github-settings.ts --apply
```

The local command obtains the GitHub API token from the authenticated `gh`
account. That token must have the repository administration and secret metadata
read permissions required by the GitHub API.

The required `GH_ADMIN_TOKEN` secret is used by drift checks and the apply
workflow. It must have the repository administration and secret metadata read
permissions required by the GitHub API. The `production` reviewer list is
empty until concrete GitHub user or team IDs are selected; no reviewer is
inferred from a repository login.

The template's `main` ruleset does not require an approving review, code-owner
review, or approval after the last push, and grants no bypass actor. It still
requires the `check`, `mutation` and `github-settings` status checks and
review-thread resolution. This is a solo-repository policy, not a default to
be relaxed later without thought; see
[ADR 0008](../../docs/decisions/0008-no-required-human-approval-solo-repo.md)
for the reasoning and the conditions under which it should change. The script
manages only named rulesets and environments. It does not delete unmanaged
GitHub settings, rulesets, environments, or secrets.
